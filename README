Eventually this will be a fully functioning 'User Interface Toolbox'.

What exactly does that mean?

  You will be able to choose from a set list of multiple UI changes including:

    Status Bar:
      Battery
      Data Movement (in and out arrows)
      Signal
      Wifi
      Clock (still haven't decided if I want to include this)

    Navigation Bar:
      Back Key
      Home Key
      Running Apps Key
      Search Key
      Legacy Menu Key

  More may come eventually but this is the base of what this application is going to be for
